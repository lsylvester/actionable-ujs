# Roadmap

* [ ] Perform actions by directly events on elements
* [ ] Make forms perform actions on submit instead of click
* [ ] Allow events that perform actions to be customized with `data-cable-on` attributes.
* [ ] Restrict `data-cable-action` click to elements that click would normally trigger events (like `a` tags)
* [ ] Support `data-cable-action` in input, textarea, select ect, with default action on change
